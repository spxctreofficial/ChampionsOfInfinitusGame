# Champions of Infinitus

Champions of Infinitus is a tactical, strategy-based card game for both veteran strategy game players and beginners alike. Champions of Infinitus is easy-to-learn, but hard to master! Play as any champion, whether it be a loyal squire, a sly bandit, or a powerful mage! Use different cards to attack, heal, or other miscellaneous actions, and use your hero's abilities to gain an advantage in the battle!

## Download & Install
Go to `ChampionsOfInfinitusGame/Releases` on our GitHub repository to download the latest version of the game. Alternatively, you can download and install a build of the game from https://www.itch.io, where I will be regularly updating as a mirror for the game's download.<br>
If you would like to help with the game's development, or simply wish to try out the latest changes that have not been built specifically as a version yet, you can alternatively clone the project and build the game from Unity. However, this is a slippery slide that can lead to many errors (and not recommended unless you know exactly what you're doing).
